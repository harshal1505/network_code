What is CLI Parser

The ansible.netcommon collection version 1.2.0 or later includes the cli_parse module that can run CLI commands and parse the semi-structured text output.

Parsing semi-structured data such as network configurations into structured data allows programmatic use of the data from that device. 
Use cases include automated troubleshooting, creating dynamic documentation, updating IPAM (IP address management) tools and so on
